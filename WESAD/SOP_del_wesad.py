## SOP_del FUNCTION
# This function obtains the BVP main biomarkers: the Onset, the Slope and
# the Peak biomarker, which are used for further delineations. If any
# feature is needed to be extracted from this signal, this delineation needs
# always to be done.
# How this function works is by using a sliding window that calculates a
# series of local maxima and minima, derivating the signal, and thanks to a
# series of thresholds, obtains the position of the biomarkers.

# Inputs for this function:
# -data_window: the acquisition window of the raw (or filtered) BVP signal
# from which the biomarkers are going to be extracted.
# -Fs: Sample frequency of the analysed signal.
# -start: index used to calculate the actual position of the biomarker,
# acordingly to the complete signal.

# Outputs for this function:
# -Slope: Vector where the extracted Slope biomarkers are saved.
# -Peak: Vector where the extracted Peak biomarkers are saved.
# -Onset: Vector where the extracted Onset biomarkers are saved.
